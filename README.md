## Setup Instructions

Locally, you can get the application running as follows (Linux and macOS):

1. Clone the repository to your computer and navigate to the flask directory.
2. Create a .env file and define its contents as follows:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql:///<database-name>
SECRET_KEY=<secret-key>
```

- where the database name is name set by the user.
- The secret key can be generated using the following commands:

```bash
$ python3
>>> import secrets
>>> secrets.token_hex(16)
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

or (Windows)

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

If you encounter the following error:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\Activate : File C:\Users\user\csb\flask\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because
running scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
At line:1 char:1
+ .\venv\Scripts\Activate
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
```

Run PowerShell as an administrator and check the current execution policy by running:

```bash
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

The current policy is likely set to "Restricted." To enable script execution for the current user (which will allow you to activate the virtual environment), run:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Now you should be able to activate the virtual environment in the flask folder by running:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Start the database in another terminal window (on Windows run it in Git Bash):

```bash
start-pg.sh
```

6. In the original terminal window, execute the following:

```bash
$ psql
user=# CREATE DATABASE <database-name>;
```

- where the database name is the same as the one you defined in step 2.

7. Define the database schema:

```bash
psql -d <database-name> <schema.sql
```

- where the database name is the same as the one you defined in step 2.

8. Start the application:

```bash
flask run
```
